## Projects that I've done here at UCSD!
**Some projects that I've enjoyed making here at UCSD through my club _Triton Software Engineering_, would be two apps called _Psyches of Color_ and _Chore-Charm_! Both of these projects help me get more comfortable in learning how to code in teams and enjoy the process!**
